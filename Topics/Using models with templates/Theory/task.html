<h2>Using models with templates</h2>
<div class="step-text">
<p>The advantage of a framework is that all parts of the framework can interact with each other easily. We have templates to render HTML pages and<em> </em>models to work with the database. In addition, we have forms. Do you remember that Django is based on the model-view-template architecture? Let's see it in action — process and pass data from the database to our HTML-templates and get it from HTML-forms to save to the database. And that's exactly what we're going to do now.</p>
<h5 id="initial-setup">Initial setup</h5>
<p>Do you like music? Maybe you want to create your music service? With this service, you'll be able to listen to various tracks, search for specific songs, and mark your favorite ones.</p>
<p>First, let's create our project using the following command:</p>
<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">django-admin startproject music_player</code></pre>
<p>And an application inside project directory for it, let's call it <code class="language-python">play</code>, for example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">python manage.py startapp play</code></pre>
<p>We've created a new application, and we certainly need to add it to the <code class="language-python">INSTALLED_APPS</code> list in the <em>settings.py </em>file.</p>
<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">INSTALLED_APPS = [
    ...	
    'play',
]
</code></pre>
<p>We don't need much for the first prototype — let's use the Django's <code class="language-python">User</code> model and define another one ourselves in <em>models.py</em> file:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">from django.contrib.auth.models import User
from django.db import models


class Song(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=128)
    artist = models.CharField(max_length=128)
    path_to_file = models.FileField(upload_to='static/')
    favorite_by = models.ManyToManyField(User, related_name='favorite_songs')</code></pre>
<p>Don't forget to migrate a newly created model:</p>
<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate</code></pre>
<p>The next step is to create a template directory inside the application directory — <em>play/templates/play</em>. For our educational purpose, we'll need two pages: <em>song_list.html</em> and <em>play_page.html</em>.</p>
<h5 id="passing-object-to-template">Passing object to template</h5>
<p>Templates are often used by views to render HTML for web pages. It's the case for Django. Within each template, you can add a basic structure:</p>
<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html lang="en"&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;meta charset="UTF-8"&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Title&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fill here&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>
<p>For now, this is plain HTML, but the idea is to turn it into dynamic content. To achieve this, we can pass a <strong>context dictionary</strong> to the template to fill it with data from our models.</p>
<p>A context is a dictionary with variable names as the key and their values as the value. Assume that you defined a context variable called <code class="language-python">song</code> and assigned it the value of your favorite song, an instance of the <code class="language-python">Song</code> class: </p>
<pre><code class="language-python">my_favorite_song = {'id': 1, 
                    'title': 'All you need is a computer, and a little belief in yourself', 
                    'artist': 'peachcake', 
                    'path_to_file': 'static/file_aync_peachcake_2005.mp3'}</code></pre>
<p>In this case, our context dictionary is <code class="language-python">{'song': favorite_song}</code>. In models, all fields will be available for the template layout, you can even access foreign keys and their fields.</p>
<p>Fancy CSS for our prototype is unnecessary, so let's create a moderate HTML code in <em>play_page.html</em>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;h4&gt;{{ song.artist }} - {{ song.title }}&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;audio controls&gt;
    &lt;source src="/{{ song.path_to_file }}" type="audio/mp3"&gt;
&lt;/audio&gt;</code></pre>
<p>The result would look like this:</p>
<p><img alt="Object passed to template" height="169" src="https://ucarecdn.com/0faf616d-475f-4392-99e0-a0e29daa86ce/" width="725"/></p>
<p>All attributes of models are accessed through the dot. The curly braces around <code class="language-python">song.attribute</code> mean that it won't be displayed on the page as-is. Instead, it'll be evaluated on the Python side and then the result will be displayed. That means the value of <code class="language-python">{{ song.artist }}</code> should now be replaced with Peachcake.</p>
<p>The <code class="language-python">path_to_file</code> is a relative path to a file from the <code class="language-python">upload_to</code> directory. Don't redefine the default value for static files in <em>settings.py</em> module and use the "<em>static</em>" folder for it as a file source prefix.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p></p><div class="alert alert-primary">
<p> </p>
<p>To make the static file directory work, create it in the root of your project and then define <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/ref/settings/#std:setting-STATICFILES_DIRS" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">STATICFILES_DIRS</a> in the <em>settings.py</em> module.</p>
<p> </p>
<p></p></div>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Place the music files to the static directory of our app. Inherit database with your favorite music tracks through Django admin panel (create the superuser and enter the panel at <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/</a>).</p>
<p>To make our service work, let's create two significant components: views and URL-paths. As the main purpose of our topic is to learn to use models with templates, let's pay less attention to this important steps.</p>
<h5 id="views">Views</h5>
<p>In Django, web pages and other content (like JSON, spreadsheets, or PDFs) are delivered by <strong>views</strong>. Each view generally serves a specific function and has a specific HTML template. For example, in our playback application, we'll need at least two view classes, one for the song list, the other for the music player pages.</p>
<p>Let's add a list of songs to <em>views.py</em> file:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">from django.views import generic
from .models import Song

class IndexView(generic.ListView):
    template_name = 'play/song_list.html'
    context_object_name = 'songs'

    def get_queryset(self):
        return Song.objects.all()</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, we're forming a <code class="language-python">QuerySet</code> of song instances from the database to pass them to the template.</p>
<p>The second page we have in mind is a detail view of an exact music track (<em>play/play_page.html</em>). So, the view class for it may be like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">class MusicFileView(generic.DetailView):
    template_name = 'play/play_page.html'
    model = Song</code></pre>
<p>Great job! To make things work, we need to tune URL-paths. Let's get to it!</p>
<h5 id="urls">URLs</h5>
<p>Django will choose a view by examining the URL that's requested by the user. We'll open the <em>urls.py</em> file of the <code class="language-python">music_player</code> project and use the <code class="language-python">include</code> function for the application <code class="language-python">play</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path, include

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('', include('play.urls')),
]</code></pre>
<p>Add the <em>urls.py</em> file to the application's directory:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">from django.urls import path
from . import views

app_name = 'play'

urlpatterns = [
    path('', views.IndexView.as_view(), name='index'),
    path('&lt;int:pk&gt;/', views.MusicFileView.as_view(), name='music_file'),
]</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, we'll create a URL-path for a music file using its primary key.</p>
<h5 id="forms">Forms</h5>
<p>One of the best features of music services is the possibility to create playlists with favorite songs; our service requires that! We extend the existing template of the <em>play_page.html</em> page with a <strong>form</strong> to be able to use it further in <code class="language-python">POST</code> requests:</p>
<pre><code class="language-html">{% if user.is_authenticated %}
&lt;h2&gt;{{ song.title  }}&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;form action="{% url 'play:likes' song.id %}" method="post"&gt;
   {% csrf_token %}
   &lt;input type="hidden" name="song_id" value="{{ song.id }}"&gt;
   &lt;button type="submit"&gt;Add to favorites&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
{% endif %}</code></pre>
<p>We access the <code class="language-python">id</code> field of a variable through the dot. If you looked closely at the code, you've noticed we're also using the cryptic tag <code class="language-python">{% csrf_token %}</code>. CSRF is an abbreviation for Cross-Site Request Forgery. We don't want any fraud action to happen, so in forms, we must always use this tag to secure our applications. The CSRF token is a generated sequence of symbols that the server uses to identify a user's session. If the sequence matches, the form is considered reliable. Furthermore, we added the '<code class="language-python">user_is_authenticated</code>' option to be able to see who liked an exact song and to create lists of favorites for authenticated users of our future service.</p>
<p>Now we have a form to send to the server; it will process the request and add the song of our choice to favorites.</p>
<p><img alt="Object and form passed to template" height="205" src="https://ucarecdn.com/0a20208c-d511-4999-a969-f6a1ef2eae14/" width="754"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p></p><div class="alert alert-primary">
<p> </p>
<p>Your request will work only if your application has a <code class="language-python">POST</code> handler for the address "<em>/add_to_favorites</em>". You can find this URL in the action field of the form.</p>
<p> </p>
<p></p></div>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h5 id="many-objects">Many objects</h5>
<p>A whole playlist will be shown on the main page, <em>song_list.html</em>, and here it's slightly different from having just one object per page. Using a <code class="language-python">for</code> loop and a <code class="language-python">QuerySet</code> would work well for a situation like that.</p>
<p>Let's update the content of our <em>song_list.html</em> file, replacing the content in the body with our list of songs dynamically. Moreover, modify the <code class="language-python">get_queryset</code> method to get ten or fewer random songs from the database. Now, our context data is <code class="language-python">{'songs': Song.objects.all()[:10]}</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-html">{% for song in songs %}
&lt;div&gt;
   &lt;h4&gt;{{ song.artist }} - {{ song.title }}&lt;/h4&gt;
   &lt;div&gt;{{ song.favorite_by.count }} likes&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
{% endfor %}</code></pre>
<p>There's another great idea — we urgently require links to the music player from playlist! So, let's change this part of code to be able to open music file pages directly from here:</p>
<pre><code class="language-html">{% for song in songs %}
&lt;ul&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="{% url 'play:music_file' song.id %}"&gt;{{ song.artist }} - {{ song.title }}&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;div&gt;{{ song.favorite_by.count }}&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
{% endfor %}</code></pre>
<p>Great! But why stop here? Let's add another great feature to our server and for each song display the number of users who added it to their favorites. To complete this, access the user's <code class="language-python">QuerySet</code> with <code class="language-python">favorite_by</code> attribute defined in the model and call the <code class="language-python">count</code> method on it. As for other Python objects, the only candidates for templates are methods with no parameters;<code class="language-python">count</code> is one of them.</p>
<p>Now the users can see which songs are really popping and rocking! </p>
<p><img alt="Many objects passed to template" height="225" src="https://ucarecdn.com/4c256de0-24aa-4bdb-805f-c403abccfaff/" width="734"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p></p><div class="alert alert-primary">
<p> </p>
<p>It's usually better to calculate such data at the stage of processing the request in a handler. We should define only the representation of a page in our template.</p>
<p> </p>
<p></p></div>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h5 id="filters">Filters</h5>
<p>Django provides filters for processing values in templates. Occasionally, they can truly save us time, yet they may also yield surprising results. The template processor uses the string representation of an object, which has its pros and cons. Being careful with that is the key to getting the most of Django.</p>
<p>Let's slightly change the template from the previous example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-html">{% for song in songs %}
&lt;ul&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="{% url 'play:music_file' song.id %}"&gt;{{ song.artist }} - {{ song.title }}&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;div&gt;Loved by {{ song.favorite_by.all|random }}&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
{% endfor %}</code></pre>
<p>We render a random <code class="language-python">User</code> who liked a song (provided we have the user's consent, of course). Upon receiving the <code class="language-python">QuerySet</code>, we pass it to the <code class="language-python">random</code> filter to get one username to show.</p>
<p>Though this feature is quite experimental, it still has a chance to win the hearts of our users, so let's render five of them instead of just one:</p>
<pre><code class="language-html">{% for song in songs %}
&lt;ul&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="{% url 'play:music_file' song.id %}"&gt;{{ song.artist }} - {{ song.title }}&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;div&gt;Loved by {{ song.favorite_by.all|slice:5 }}&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
{% endfor %}</code></pre>
<p>We sliced the <code class="language-python">QuerySet</code> and limited its length to five items: what could go wrong? Yet, when we open the browser, we get the strange output:</p>
<p><img alt="Wrong passing of QuerySet" height="124" src="https://ucarecdn.com/6cc95ab7-73a8-4383-9b39-97ee0f0242ba/" width="1299"/></p>
<p>What kind of English is that? It seems like Django converted the <code class="language-python">QuerySet</code> to a string and rendered it to HTML. It's not a result to be particularly proud of. Don't lose heart, though, as we have another trick up our sleeve:</p>
<pre><code class="language-html">{% for song in songs %}
&lt;ul&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="{% url 'play:music_file' song.id %}"&gt;{{ song.artist }} - {{ song.title }}&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;div&gt;Loved by {{ song.favorite_by.all|slice:5|unordered_list }}&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
{% endfor %}</code></pre>
<p>This time, we prudently convert all values to an HTML <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/ref/templates/builtins/#unordered-list" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">unordered list</a> with the <code class="language-python">unordered_list</code> filter, and our output now looks quite satisfying:</p>
<p><img alt="Correct passing of QuerySet" height="220" src="https://ucarecdn.com/0a6fca82-9784-4702-b6a2-e3e18da98754/" width="515"/></p>
<p>Fine! What else do we need to make the form of adding to favorites work? Of course, we need to add a view function for it to <em>views.py</em>!</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">from django.http import HttpResponseRedirect
from django.shortcuts import get_object_or_404
from django.urls import reverse


def likes(request, id):
    song = get_object_or_404(Song, id=request.POST.get('song_id'))
    if song.favorite_by.filter(id=request.user.id).exists():
        song.favorite_by.remove(request.user)
    else:
        song.favorite_by.add(request.user)
    return HttpResponseRedirect(reverse('play:index'))</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, we don't need to use a special page for likes, just redirect to the same page. </p>
<p>And we need the URL-path for this action, just add it to patterns in <em>play/urls.py:</em></p>
<pre><code class="language-python">urlpatterns = [
    path('', views.IndexView.as_view(), name='index'),
    path('&lt;int:pk&gt;/', views.MusicFileView.as_view(), name='music_file'),
    path('&lt;int:id&gt;/likes/', views.likes, name='likes'),
]</code></pre>
<p>Well, there are plenty of ideas to expand our service with some more options, but let's stop by now and continue practicing Django!</p>
<h5 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h5>
<p>While working with our music player, we've got in touch with principles of Django models' use in HTML templates.</p>
<p>Let's summarize what we've learned:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>the way we can pass objects from the database to the template;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>how to access model's attributes for different purposes;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>how to represent organized lists of objects, how to sort them and use filters;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>finally, we've seen some examples of forms, view functions and URL patterns we can create to represent data from the database.</p>
